# ðŸ“Š HR Analytics Dashboard â€“ Tableau

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This **HR Analytics Dashboard** provides an in-depth view of employee data to uncover patterns in **attrition**, **salary trends**, **work-life balance**, and **employee satisfaction**.  
By integrating data from multiple HR sources and visualizing it in Tableau, the project aims to help HR departments make **data-driven decisions** to improve retention, optimize workforce planning, and enhance job satisfaction.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Description
The analysis is based on two datasets: **HR_1** and **HR_2**.  
After cleaning and preprocessing in **Excel**, both datasets were merged for Tableau visualization.

| Dataset | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **HR_1** | Employee demographics, job roles, departments, salaries, gender, and education fields. |
| **HR_2** | Attrition status, work-life balance scores, performance ratings, total working years, promotions, and years in current role/company. |

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights
1. **Attrition Patterns:**
   - Employees with **fewer promotions** in their career tend to have higher attrition rates.
   - Mid-career employees (10â€“20 years of experience) show moderate attrition, but rates spike near retirement age in some roles.

2. **Salary Impact:**
   - Lower average monthly income correlates with slightly higher attrition.
   - Some roles (e.g., **Sales Executives**) maintain high attrition despite competitive pay, suggesting non-monetary factors.

3. **Gender & Diversity:**
   - Workforce is almost evenly split between **male (50.12%)** and **female (49.88%)** employees.

4. **Work-Life Balance & Satisfaction:**
   - Employees reporting **Excellent** work-life balance and **Very High** job satisfaction show the **lowest attrition**.
   - "Average" and "Bad" work-life balance scores are linked to higher turnover.

5. **Role-specific Trends:**
   - **Research Scientists** have the lowest attrition rate (~48.9%) but also lower average monthly income.
   - **Sales-related roles** see consistently high attrition despite varied pay scales.
